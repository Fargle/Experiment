# Objective
A project that attempts to abstract away the minutia of running data science experiments. From developing a model to interpreting the results, the time it takes to get results that are both reliable and interpretable can be a long and tedious process. This project attempts to create a user interface with your data and model to offer a wide variety of tools that will help you understand your model and your data without the need to write any code.
